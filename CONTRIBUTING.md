# Contributing to the Traefik Hackaethon

We have outlined several ways in which you may contribute during the Traefik Hackaethon.

- [Open Source - Good First Issues / Help Wanted](/ISSUES.md)
- [Open Source - Plugin Ideas](/PLUGINS.md)

## Working as a team

If you'd like to work with a group or team, please self-organize in the Discord general room and ask for people who are willing to help you undertake a task.

## Claiming an Issue / Plugin

Keeping track of ongoing work is important during a hackathon, as we want to ensure that there is as little duplication of effort as possible. Please help us by following these guidelines.

### Before you start!

Check the [Daily Reports](/daily/README.md) for the status of on-going work before you or your team decide on claiming an issue or plugin. Once you've decided on what to work on, you should contact one of the event moderators listed below so they can update this repository and ensure duplicate work isn't taking place.

| Name          | Hours               | Discord Handle | Email                    |
|---------------|---------------------|----------------|--------------------------|

## Abandoned work

**!! IMPORTANT !!** 

Check in your code daily before 1800 ET. The event moderators are responsible for keeping track of on-going activity, and if you don't check in your code the issue or plugin you're working on may be considered abandoned.

Abandoned issues and plugins may be reassigned. Be sure to commit and check in code _daily_ to your fork/repository to ensure that your work in progress is recognized. This will ensure a smooth event for everyone.
